## Summary

- The project follows a layered structure (`api`, `domain`, `infrastructure`) and central `server.ts` bootstrap.
- Strong separation of HTTP (REST), WebSocket (WS), domain services, and infrastructure adapters is evident.
- Security and operational middleware (Helmet, CSRF cookies, CORS, cookie parsing) are configured early.
- Opportunities exist to standardize cross-cutting concerns, dependency injection, error handling and DTO validation.

---

## Structure & Layering

- `api/` contains:
  - `routes/REST/` (Express routers/controllers)
  - `routes/WS/` (WebSocket gateway, routers, controllers)
  - `middleware/` (e.g., `csrf`)
  - `di/` (dependency injection bindings if present)
- `domain/` contains:
  - `entities/` (e.g., `User.ts`, `Room.ts`, `Message.ts`, `Friend.ts`, `UserSession.ts`)
  - `interfaces/` (ports for databases, storage, cache)
  - `services/` (application/domain services; orchestration, business rules)
- `infrastructure/` contains:
  - `db/` (adapters/implementations for databases; schema bootstrap handled at connection time)

This layering matches Clean Architecture intent: `api` depends on `domain`, `infrastructure` implements `domain` interfaces. Ensure no inward dependency from `domain` to `api` or framework-specific code.

---

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**
  - Entities in `domain/entities/` hold domain state/behavior; controllers in `api/routes/*/controllers` handle transport; services in `domain/services/` encapsulate use-cases. SRP is generally respected.
  - Recommendation: keep controllers thin; avoid embedding business logic in controllers.

- **Open/Closed**
  - Domain interfaces (ports) in `domain/interfaces/` allow new infrastructure implementations without changing domain code (good).
  - Recommendation: extend via new implementations under `infrastructure/` and configure via DI.

- **Liskov Substitution**
  - Applies to interface-based adapters (DB/Cache/Storage). Ensure implementations fully respect interface contracts (e.g., return types, error semantics).

- **Interface Segregation**
  - Splitting `interfaces/` into logical folders (db, cache, storage) is positive. Validate each interface is minimal and cohesive (avoid kitchen-sink interfaces).

- **Dependency Inversion**
  - `domain` uses interfaces; infrastructure implements them (good). Check that **composition root** binds concrete adapters to interfaces (likely in `api/di/` or WS/REST gateway constructors). Controllers/services should depend on interfaces only.

---

## Clean Architecture Practices

- **Entities**: `domain/entities/*.ts` define core models; they should remain framework-agnostic and avoid persistence/transport concerns.
- **Use Cases / Services**: `domain/services/*` should be pure business workflows orchestrating repositories and entities.
- **Interfaces / Ports**: `domain/interfaces/*` define repository or gateway contracts.
- **Adapters**: `infrastructure/db/*` implement repositories.
- **Delivery**: `api/routes/REST` and `api/routes/WS` adapt HTTP/WebSocket requests to use-cases.

Recommendations:
- Provide DTOs for input/output at boundaries (validation & mapping). `domain/dto/` is present; populate and use consistently.
- Centralize mapping between DTOs and entities (e.g., map layer or mappers in `api`).
- Ensure circular dependencies are avoided (domain must not import from api/infrastructure).

---

## Security & Operational Concerns

- `server.ts` sets:
  - Helmet with CSP: good; `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is kept conservative for the test UI. Validate production policy carefully.
  - CORS with configured `FRONTEND_URL` and credentials: OK.
  - CSRF: `issueCsrfCookie` and `verifyCsrfToken` for `/api` mutations: good defense.
  - Static files from `public/` served after security middleware: OK.
  - `trust proxy`: configured from `TRUST_PROXY`. Good for accurate client IPs.
  - Redis connection lifecycle in `start()`: connects and gracefully disconnects on SIGINT/SIGTERM.

Recommendations:
- Rate limiters for REST endpoints and web socket authentication endpoints (especially auth/login/room creation) using the trusted IP.
- Input validation for REST (e.g., zod/joi/class-validator) and structured error handling.
- Explicit CORS `allowedHeaders` to include Authorization if needed.

---

## Error Handling & Logging

- `Logger` abstraction exists. Ensure controllers/services log context-rich messages (userId, roomId, messageId) and return sanitized errors to the client.
- Recommendation: standard error shape (code, message, details) to clients; map technical errors to 4xx/5xx consistently.

---

## Testing Strategy

Recommendations:
- Unit tests: services and mappers with mocks for interfaces in `domain/interfaces`.
- Integration tests: against `infrastructure/db` repositories with a test DB setup.
- End-to-end tests: minimal suite to validate WS handshake, room join, send/receive, friend flows.

---

## Consistency & Style

- TypeScript configuration under `server/Express/tsconfig.json` should enforce strictness where possible in server code (null checks, noImplicitAny). Consider enabling `strict` gradually.
- Use consistent naming: Controllers end with `*Controller`, Services with `*Service`, Interfaces with `I*` or placed in `interfaces/` folders.
- Keep public APIs documented (JSDoc on services/controllers methods) since this is a collaborative codebase.

---

## Dependency Injection

- If `api/di/` provides a container, prefer constructor injection for controllers/services.
- Composition root(s): `server.ts` (for app-wide), `api/routes/WS/router/WebSocketGateway.ts` (for WS), and REST router bootstrap. Bind concrete infra implementations there.
- Avoid service locator anti-pattern (global singletons) except for cross-cutting infrastructure (e.g., Logger) if justified.

---

## WebSocket Design

- `api/routes/WS/` exports a `WebSocketGateway`, `WsRouter`, and multiple Controllers. This is a good separation.
- Use message/action schemas (type-safe) for inbound/outbound messages; validate payloads before invoking services.
- Ensure per-connection context (`WsContext`) carries authenticated identity and scoped resources.

---

## Database & Repositories

- `infrastructure/db/*` should implement `domain/interfaces/dbInterfaces/*`.
- Validate transaction boundaries for multi-step operations (create room + add users + initial message, etc.).
- Prefer returning domain entities or DTOs, not raw DB rows, at boundaries.

---

## Actionable Improvements

1. **Validation Layer**
   - Add schema validation (zod/joi) for REST/WS payloads and centralize 400/422 error responses.

2. **DTO Usage**
   - Normalize input/output DTOs and mapping; ensure controllers don’t return entities with private fields.

3. **Strict TS**
   - Gradually enable `strict` in server `tsconfig.json` and fix surfaced issues.

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Apply per-IP and/or per-user rate limits on sensitive endpoints and WS actions.

5. **Observability**
   - Structured logging, request IDs, and minimal metrics counters (auth success/failure, ws connections, messages per room).

6. **Testing Baseline**
   - Introduce unit + integration test skeletons to lock behavior early.

7. **Docs**
   - For each layer, add short README (interfaces, services, infra adapter responsibilities) to reduce onboarding time.
